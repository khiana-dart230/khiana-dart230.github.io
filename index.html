    <h2>The Little Fox</h2>
    <p>In a den within the hills,</p>
    <p>The sun shines <strong>bright</strong> upon the <em>slumbering</em>,</p>
    <p>Where a fox awakens, groggy yet still.</p>
    <p>The fox, so <em>little</em> and <strong>eager</strong> for the day</p>
    <p>Finds it is motherless, left with only footprints in the dirt.</p>
    <p>So the fox <em>wandered</em> curious as to where she went <strong>away</strong>.</p>
  <br>
    <p>There the fox <em>trots</em>, on and on for a while,</p>
    <p>Down a small, narrow path the little fox has been down once,</p>
    <p>Soon the bug filled path lead to a river, it came across its mother with a <strong>smile</strong>.</p>
    <p>For you see, she had simply went to drink some water.</p>
    <p>So the little fox joined in, as the journey was a bit of a <strong>bother</strong>.
